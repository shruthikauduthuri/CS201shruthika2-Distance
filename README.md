The program will do the following:
a. Generate 4 random values: x1,y1,x2, and y2 which are coordinate points:
(x1,y1) and (x2,y2) where each value is an integer between -10 and 10, inclusive.
b. Calculate the distance of each point to the origin
c. Print each point, its distance to the origin & which point (1 or 2) is closer to the
origin
d. Loop until the user decides to quit
e. Bonus: allow the user to decide to enter these 4 values or let the program
